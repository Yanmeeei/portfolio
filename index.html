  <h2>Legend of Zelda 1986 - Unity Remaster</h2>
  <h3>About the Project:</h3>
  <p>This is a Unity remaster of the classic 1986 game <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, with a customized extra level that features new maps, weapons, and mechanisms. </p>
  <h3>My Contributions:</h3>
  <p>Xiaoyu Liu (link) and I developed the remaster. I am responsible for implementing various enemies, camera/room transitions, doorways and blockers, enemy/collectable power-up placements, customized level map generation, and relevant testing/bug fixes. We worked together on audio implementation and customized level design.</p>
  <h3>Technology Used:</h3>
  <p>The remaster was developed using the programming language C#, a robust and widely-used programming language in the gaming industry, and the Unity, a popular game engine that provides a suite of tools and features for cross-platform game development. The remaster utilizes the capabilities of Unity to bring a modern touch to the classic game while maintaining the original charm and gameplay. 

    The WebGL build of the game is hosted on Github Page, a web hosting service that allows developers to host static web pages directly from a GitHub repository.
